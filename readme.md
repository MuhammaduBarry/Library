# Welcome To My Odin Project : Library

I started this project with the vision of completing it in a day, oh boy was a wrong. Constantly i would get stuck and i would be frustrated.

But this is part of my learning journey, the sooner i learn to accept the fact that anything that is valuable like a skill, it is going to come with it's

own difficulties.
