4. event.preventDefault Method.

I started this project with the vision of completing it in a day, oh boy was i wrong. Constantly i would get stuck and i would be frustrated.

But this is part of my learning journey, the sooner i learn to accept the fact that anything that is valuable like a skill, it is going to come with

it's own difficulties. Life is about continuous progress and hopefully i'll get better at the art of code. Thank you for reading this and have a

blessed day.
